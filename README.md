üßæ Bazaar Inventory Tracking System
This repository documents the development of a scalable Inventory Tracking System built in Python, evolving from a single-store CLI prototype to a multi-store, production-ready backend platform. This solution was designed in response to the Bazaar Technologies engineering challenge focusing on real-time stock visibility, scalability, auditability, and reliability.

1)Design Decisions:

Language & Framework
    Used Python for its readability, rapid prototyping capabilities, and extensive ecosystem.
    Chose Flask for REST API development in later stages due to its simplicity and flexibility.

Architecture
    Adopted a modular design separating core logic, API layer, and database access.
    Designed for evolution across three stages: CLI ‚ûù REST API ‚ûù Scalable Service.
    Used SQLite in Stage 1 for simplicity, transitioning to PostgreSQL for Stage 2+, ensuring relational integrity and scalability.

Data Modeling
    Modeled Products, StockMovements, and Stores (added in Stage 2).
    Central Product Catalog added in Stage 2 to ensure consistency across stores.
    Introduced AuditLogs in Stage 3 for traceability.

Security & Reliability
    Implemented basic authentication in Stage 2 and rate limiting using Flask-Limiter.
    In Stage 3, designed for horizontal scalability and asynchronous processing using event queues (e.g., RabbitMQ/Kafka).

2)Assumptions
    Each product has a unique global ID.
    A stock movement can be of type: stock-in, sale, or manual-removal.
    Stage 1 uses local SQLite; Stage 2+ uses PostgreSQL.
    Stage 2 introduces multiple stores, and each store maintains its own stock ledger.
    Stage 3 includes concurrent operations, event-driven architecture, and audit logs.

3)API Design (Stage 2 & 3)

üß¨ Evolution Rationale (v1 ‚Üí v3)
1) Stage 1: Single Store ‚Äì CLI or Basic API

    CLI-based or basic REST API using Flask + SQLite.
    Tracks product entries, stock-in, sales, and manual removal.
    All data stored locally in a single flat file or SQLite database.
    Focus: core inventory logic and product model.

2) Stage 2: Multi-Store Support
    Transitioned to PostgreSQL to manage relational data efficiently.
    Added store-specific stock, central product catalog.
    Introduced REST API with filtering (by date/store/product).

    Added:
        Authentication (Basic Auth)
        Rate limiting for APIs
        Reporting APIs per store or product
       Ensures system can scale to 500+ stores with centralized control.

3) Stage 3: Scalable & Auditable Platform
    Designed for thousands of stores and high concurrency.

    Introduced:
        Asynchronous stock updates via event queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
        Read/write DB separation, caching, rate limiting
        Audit logging for all inventory changes
        Horizontal scalability considerations using container orchestration
        Deployed in a microservices-ready structure.
